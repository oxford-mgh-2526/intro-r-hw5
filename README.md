# Homework 5

- `a_vectors.R`
- `b_lists.R`

contain several bugs which are preventing it from executing
from beginning to end without being interrupted by the `stopifnot` function.
Your objective is to find and fix these bugs. You must do so

- Only edit lines that says "<< edit"
- Without modifying the `stopifnot` functions
- Without removing/adding any new lines to this script (also, don't use any `;`)
